# orthfx

orthfx is an organization dedicated to building Orthodox Christian digital tools and resources. We develop open-source applications that help people engage with scripture, prayer, and Orthodox Christian content.

Our projects range from Bible reading apps and Discord bots to multi-tenant platforms and subscription services, all built with modern web technologies like Next.js, React, and TypeScript.
